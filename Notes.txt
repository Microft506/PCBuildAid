The software will mostly revolve around the PCBuild object. 

The PCBuild object will allow multiple pieces of hardware to be installed.
An even queue will be raised whenever the hardware in the PC has been changed.

Compatibility is checked by calling the isCompatibleWith routine on the PCBuild object.
This function will check to see if the existing hardware is compatible with the new piece.
